# Task 2
## The Canonical Second Program

Write a program that prompts the user to enter their name. It should store the name and then use it to print a cheery greeting. It should look something like:

    Hello. What is your name? Sir Robin
    Well met, Sir Robin! It is good to meet you!

In the event the user does not enter anything, the program should respond as shown here:

    Hello. What is your name? 
    Well met, Mysterious Stranger! How shall we learn your name?

Remember to commit it to your repo.
