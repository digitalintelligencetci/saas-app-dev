# Task 4
## Maths Test

*Do not worry if you cannot complete all of this program. It is a bit more complicated, and intended for those who completed the earlier programs easily.*

*Tune in to the lecture on Friday for a solution!*

Write a program that creates and runs a multiplication test that might be used for a child learning arithmetic. The test should present 10 simple multiplication sums (one at a time), and should ask the user to enter the answers (again, one at a time). It should keep score, and give the final number answered correctly at the end.

The sums should be randomly generated. They should be simple, so only numbers between 0 and 12 (inclusive) should be used. For example, the output of a version limited to five sums might be:

    9 x 0 = 0
    Correct!
    6 x 7 = 42
    Correct!
    6 x 0 = 6
    Gah! That's not right!
    4 x 9 = 54
    Gah! That's not right!
    6 x 0 = 0
    Correct!
    
    You got 3 right!

As shown, there is no need to worry about the program generating duplicate sums! Nor is there any need to repeat any that are answered incorrectly.

Commit your program, showing how far you have got with this. Commit even if you only manage to implement one sum!
