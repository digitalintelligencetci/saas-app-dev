# Additional Work

This folder contains additional work that I have completed, outside of the weekly practical sheets.

These were done to help me learn more about Python and programming in general. 

Also, originally stored in my personal logbook repository, I've moved them here to keep all my work in one place.

I've stored in here the work I've done from the following sources:
- Lab examples and exercises from FOCP class.
- Follow along exercises from Python Tutorial - Python for Beginners [Full Course] by Programming with Mosh on YouTube.
