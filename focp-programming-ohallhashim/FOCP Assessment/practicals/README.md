# Practical Sheet Programs

Store your programs from the "weekly" practical sheets in these folders.

You can use any file names you like, as long as it is obvious what programs that contain. It would be a good idea to include a ``README.md`` file in each folder to show clearly what you have done.

Use the final folder (``99-additional-work``) if you have completed any other programs from other sources, such as books or YouTube videos. Use any folder structure you like there but you should include a README to document what is included.

*Note that there is a ``.gitkeep`` file in some of these folders. This is simply the standard way to force Git to allow an empty folder to be added to a repo. You can delete it when you have added content to a folder, or leave it alone; it makes no difference.*
