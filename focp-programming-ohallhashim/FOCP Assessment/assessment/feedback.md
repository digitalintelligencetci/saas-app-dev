## 0. Practicals and Exercises

In here are lab exercises done during Tuesday's lab seminar sessions. Practicals 05 and 08 are not included as they were not completed.

## 1. Task 1: Pizza Prices

Pizza program that asks the user how many pizzas are ordered and has functions to define the total cost, discounts (for Tuesdays and orders via the app) and delivery charge. The program then prints the total cost of the order. This was a simple and straight forward program with arithmetic functions. This program is completed with no apparent errors.

## 2. Task 2: The Cat Shelter

This program is command line based and is used to output simple statistics about both shelter and intruder cats that goes in and out. The program is completed with no apparent errors.

## 3. Task 3: Managing Passwords

This program is command line based and is used to manage passwords. I've done scripts for adduser, deluser and login. Login.py was interesting as I used fuctions for the first time such as import getpass to allow the user to input the password without it being echoed. The last script for password change is a bit of a challenge in which I will complete after marking and tutor feedback is completed. The first 3 programs are completed with no apparent errors.
