// JavaScript Basics #1: Variable and Data Type Basics

let city = "London"; // let variable because it can be changed later
const pi = 3.14159; // const variable because it should not change
let isSunny = true; // boolean variable, can be true or false
console.log(city); // logs the value of city to the console   
console.log(pi); // logs the value of pi to the console
console.log(isSunny); // logs the value of isSunny to the console

// const creates a constant names pi
// it's value is a number, which is written without quotes
